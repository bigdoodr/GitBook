This recipe makes a great cookie! You can tailor it to your liking: take them out a bit early for softer cookies, or bake them a little longer for a crisp cookie. I divided the dough and added raisins to one batch; chocolate chips to the second; and Craisins & white chocolate to the third, which were absolutely delicious! Of course, they were great without adding anything. I did reduce the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added 1/2 tsp ground cloves which gave them an even better taste. Also, I didn't grease the pan, chill the dough, or flatten w/fork and they turned out just fine. Try it for yourself!  [Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19247/soft-oatmeal-cookies/)

True to their name, these cookies were quite soft, and tasty too! I didn't find it necessary to refrigerate the dough, and rolling it into balls was too time-consuming. I just made your basic drop cookies using a spoon. I also tried flattening some using a fork dipped in sugar, but it really didn't make a difference. In my opinion, you can just skip that step. I will definitely make these again!!  [Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19247/soft-oatmeal-cookies/)

These were great! the first time i made oatmeal cookies and a total success. i chose this recipe cos it said 'soft', which is what i wanted and they really are - lovely and moist, chewy and with v.good oatmeal flavour. changed a few things - added 1 1/2 cups raisins, so cut white sugar to 2/3 cup so they wouldn't be overly sweet. next time might try cutting to 1/2 cup cos i dont think the cookies need the extra sugar. also used margarine instead of butter. unfortunately realised that i didn't have enough cinnamon (only about 1 small teaspoon!) so next time i'll make sure i have the right amount. found this dough really easy to work with. had to knead the raisins in by hand cos it was too thick to stir, but that was ok. after chilling it rolled really easily into balls without being sticky! i baked the cookies on parchment paper, and made 30. baked for 8 minutes - they come out looking way too doughy, but give them 5 minutes and they firm up to perfection! tip - i found that these cookies do not spread and flatten much by themselves, so i'd advise anyone to flatten the balls a lot before putting them in the oven. i'll be making these again and again!! :)  [Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19247/soft-oatmeal-cookies/)

The perfect oatmeal cookie. No rocket science here--simple to mix, simple to bake, great results. Bake longer for chewier, shorter time for softer cookies, add nuts or raisins if you like or just as is. Nice oatmeal flavor with just a hint of cinnamon and not overshadowed by a ton of spices. Just that simple.  [Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19247/soft-oatmeal-cookies/)
