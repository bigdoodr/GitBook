# Ingredients

- 8 cups (14 oz) store-bought unseasoned stuffing cubes
- 1 stick (½ cup) unsalted butter
- 1.5 cups diced yellow onion (from 1 large or 2 small onions)
- 1 cup diced celery (from 3 large celery stalks)
- 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 lb. bulk sweet Italian sausage
- 2.75 cups low sodium chicken broth
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon fresh chopped rosemary
- 1 tablespoon fresh chopped sage
- ¼ cup fresh chopped parsley
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9“x13” baking dish with butter.
2. Place the stuffing cubes in a large mixing bowl.
3. In a large sauté pan, melt the butter.
4. Add the onions and celery. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 8 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft.
5. Add the garlic. Cook 2 minutes more.
6. Mix cooked vegetables with the stuffing cubes. (Don’t wash the pan but scrape out every last bit of vegetables, otherwise they will burn in the next step.)
7. In the same pan, cook the sausage over medium heat for 8-10 minutes, until browned and cooked through, breaking up the sausage with a metal spatula while cooking (the largest pieces should be no greater than ¼“).
8. Add the browned sausage and fat to the cubes and vegetables mix.
9. Add the chicken broth, egg, rosemary, sage, parsley, salt and pepper to the bread cube mixture.
10. Mix until the bread is soft and moistened.
11. Transfer the stuffing to the prepared baking dish and bake for 65-75 minutes, uncovered, until deeply golden and crisp on top.

**Freezer-Friendly Instructions:** This dish can be frozen, after baking, tightly covered, for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to serve it, defrost in the refrigerator for 24 hours then reheat it, covered with foil, in a 325°F oven until hot. You can also make the stuffing ahead and refrigerate it until you’re ready to bake, up to two days in advance.
