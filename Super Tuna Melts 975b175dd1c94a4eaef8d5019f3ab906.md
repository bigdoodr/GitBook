# Ingredients

- 2 (5-ounce) cans water-packed white tuna, drained
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- ⅓ cup finely diced onion
- 2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter (½ stick), at room temperture
- 4 slices country white bread
- 6 slices vine-ripened tomato
- 6 thick or 12 thin cheddar cheese slices

# Preparation

1. In a bowl, combine the tuna, mayo, onion, relish, mustard, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper and mix until incorporated.
2. Spread 1 tablespoon of butter on one side of each piece of bread, then flip the slices over so they are buttered-side down. Divide the tuna mixture between 2 slices of bread, then top with the tomato slices and cheddar. Place the remaining 2 slices of bread on top, buttered-side up.
3. Heat a heavy skillet over low heat and toast the sandwiches in it until the cheese is melted and the bread is golden and toasty, 5 to 6 minutes per side.
