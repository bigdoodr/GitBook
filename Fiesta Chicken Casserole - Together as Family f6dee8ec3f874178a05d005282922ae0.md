## CHICKEN CASSEROLE (FIESTA CHICKEN CASSEROLE)

This chicken casserole is one of my family's favorite dinner recipes! Fiesta chicken casserole is a creamy and cheesy casserole with chicken, black beans, corn, and seasonings. It's just mild enough in flavor for the kids but can easily be adapted to spicy.

It needs no chopping, which makes it truly easy to make, and you can use leftover chicken, a rotisserie chicken, or even canned chicken.

## INGREDIENTS NEEDED TO MAKE THIS EASY CASSEROLE RECIPE

- **Rotini Pasta** - This is a spiral shaped pasta and it does work the best in this recipe. It's just big enough to hold all the good stuff and the creamy sauce.
- **Sour Cream** For best flavor use full fat sour cream. The light sour cream tends to be more watery and does not taste nearly as good as the real stuff.
- **Salsa** Use your favorite salsa here.
- **Taco Seasoning** - I prefer to use a packet of mild taco seasoning but feel free to use regular or even a hot taco seasoning to spice it up.
- **Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, and Cumin**
- **Canned Corn**
- **Black Beans** This can easily be substituted with another bean. Just make sure the can size is the same and that you drain and rinse the beans.
- **Shredded Cheese** - Use whatever kind you love! I always have Colby-Jack cheese in the fridge so that's what I use.

No chopping needed! Boil the pasta noodles. While the noodles are boiling mix together the sour cream, salsa and seasonings. When the noodles are done drain them (but do not rinse them) and add them into the sour cream mix. Stir together and add the remaining ingredients.

Spread it into the casserole dish and top with the remaining cheese. Cover with foil and bake. Uncover the casserole dish and bake for a few more minutes.

I love to put some toppings into bowls and then let everyone top their serving with whatever they want. Our favorites are sour cream and chopped tomatoes. Other good topping options are avocado slices, jalapeÃ±os for some spice, [*guacamole*](https://togetherasfamily.com/salsa-verde-guacamole/), pico de gallo, or try my [*fiesta avocado salad*](https://togetherasfamily.com/fiesta-avocado-salad/), or even some additional shredded cheese.

## TIPS & HELPFUL HINTS FOR MAKING FIESTA CHICKEN CASSEROLE

- 
    
    ### What can I use instead of chicken?
    
    - We love chicken in this recipe but feel free to use whatever meat you want. Just make sure it's still the 2.5 cups that are called for in the recipe. Also, it needs to be cooked. This casserole was not designed for raw meat. I know lots of people have used leftover shredded pork or even cooked and seasoned ground beef or ground chicken.
- 
    
    ### How can I make this spicy? Or make it more flavorful?
    
    - This is so easy to adjust to your heat/spice level. Top the serving with jalapeÃ±os. Add a can of diced green chilies in with the other seasonings. Use a packet of hot taco seasoning. Add some cayenne pepper or chili powder in with the seasonings. Use Pepper Jack cheese.
    - If you want more flavor, but not spice, then increase the seasonings to 1 teaspoon.
- 
    
    ### Can I freeze fiesta chicken casserole?
    
    - I have personally never frozen this casserole recipe but I would imagine it would freeze fine. I don't like freezing stuff like this because I think pasta once it's frozen and thawed has a weird texture to it. But if you are familiar with freezing then I am sure this casserole would freeze just fine.
- 
    
    ### Sour Cream
    
    - For best taste please use full-fat sour cream. The light sour cream tends to have more water in it and it does not taste nearly as good as the real stuff.
    - I love to use the fresh salsa that you can find in the produce area at the grocery store.
    - For best taste you want to make sure you are using good tasting ingredients like fresh salsa and real sour cream.
- 
    
    ### Can I use a different pasta?
    
    - I would highly recommend using rotini pasta for this. I have tested this recipe so many times and the rotini is the best because it's large enough to hold all the good stuff like corn, black beans, as well as soak up the sauce in the spirals.

### Notes

**Cheese :** Use any cheese you like! I use Colby Jack Cheese but feel free to use Monterey Jack, Pepper Jack, or Cheddar.  **Salsa :** Use your favorite salsa. I prefer to use a refrigerated fresh salsa that you can find in the produce area at the grocery store.  **Can I make this spicy?** Yes! Add some cayenne pepper or chili powder in with the other seasonings. Use a packet of hot taco seasoning. Top the servings with jalapeÃ±o. Add a can of diced green chilies into the casserole.  *This recipe has been updated with more helpful text, updated pictures, and updated recipe in March 2021. The original recipe only called for 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon onion powder, and 1 teaspoon garlic powder. To up the flavor I reduced the seasonings to Â½ teaspoon and added a packet of taco seasoning. I also increased the pasta amount and chicken amount to 2.5 cups each. This recipe has always gotten really good and really bad reviews so I have been retesting it to find better ratios.*
