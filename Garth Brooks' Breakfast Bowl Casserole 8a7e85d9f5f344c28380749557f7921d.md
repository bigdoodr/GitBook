# Ingredients

- 1 pound bacon
- 1 pound pork breakfast sausage
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups whole milk
- 1 can refrigerated biscuits
- 10-12 ounces pre-shredded cheddar cheese
- 10-12 ounces garlic and cheese tortellini, thawed if frozen (you could use another flavor, but Garth will be upset)
- 10 eggs
- 1 - 1.5 pounds frozen tater tots
- Salt and pepper, to taste

# Instructions

1. Cook the bacon until super-crispy.
2. Make the gravy:
    1. Cook the sausage over medium heat in your biggest, deepest ovenproof skillet until crisp and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes. Scoop out one big slotted spoonful and reserve it for the topping.
    2. Add the flour to the skillet and stir for a minute, then gradually stir in the milk.
    3. Simmer for five minutes until smooth and thick.
    4. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
    5. Pour the gravy into a separate bowl, leaving a thin layer on the bottom of the skillet.
3. Take half the canned biscuits and tear them into smallish chunks. Scatter those across the bottom of the gravy skillet.
4. Crumble all but a handful of the bacon over the top.
5. Sprinkle on half the cheese.
6. Dollop half of the gravy over that.
7. Spread the tortellini evenly over the first layer of gravy.
8. Pour the remaining gravy on top.
9. Add more cheese, reserving a handful or two for the topping.
10. Optional: For a more solid, pie-like casserole, tear the remaining biscuits into strips and press them around sides of the skillet. Skip if you prefer your breakfast piles on the gooey side.
11. Whisk the eggs together with a splash of milk and lots of salt and pepper; pour into the skillet.
12. Press a piece of parchment onto the surface of the casserole and wrap tightly with foil.
13. Bake the covered casserole on a sheet pan for 35-40 minutes at 350ºF.
14. Remove the parchment and foil.
15. Arrange the tater tots over the surface of the casserole.
16. Increase heat to 425ºF.
17. Top with the reserved cheese, bacon, and sausage.
18. Return the skillet to the sheet pan.
19. Bake for another 15-20 minutes, until the tater tots are golden brown and the casserole is bubbling hot.
20. Cool for 10 minutes.
21. Serve in slices or scoops, topping with hot sauce, if desired.
