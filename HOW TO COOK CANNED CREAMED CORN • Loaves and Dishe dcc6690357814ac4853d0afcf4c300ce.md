Now, **I KNOW** you have some questions like‚Ä¶

## WHAT EXACTLY IS CREAMED CORN?

Creamed corn is a canned corn where the kernels are removed from the ear as well as the ‚Äúmilk‚Äù from the cob. The ‚Äúmilk‚Äù is removed by scraping the cob well with a knife and this removes the ends of the corn pieces that adhere to the cob as well as the sweet milky looking juice. **YUM**!

These are then cooked up and canned or frozen for your later enjoyment!

## TIPS AND TRICKS FOR CREAMED CORN

- While I usually tell you to drain a canned food and then add water back, in this case, no. The liquid part of the can is important for the flavor here, so please leave it in there!
- Adding the cream and sugar is optional, however, if you want your creamed corn to taste like homemade, I think it is important.

## A VERSE TO SHARE

In Matthew, Jesus tells about how God will separate people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. I pray, dear God, that I will have been good enough to be a sheep.

I ask you, PLEASE, go read Matthew 25. It says that when Jesus sits upon his throne, **ALL THE PEOPLE FROM ALL THE NATIONS** will be gathered together in front of him and he will separate them one from another.

### ALL THE PEOPLE FROM ALL THE NATIONS. That is exactly what the Bible says.

It **DOES NOT** say, he will separate the Americans good from bad, the Mexicans good from bad or the Syrians good from bad. Nope. It says **ALL THE PEOPLE FROM ALL THE NATIONS.**

Why does it say that?

Well, I‚Äôm not Bible scholar **BUT** it implies to me that God loves **EVERYONE** from all nations and that **HE** sees us **ALL** as his children. **HIS** children will be found in **ALL** nations and he will divide the good ones from the bad ones.

If you follow that reasoning out, you will also believe that while we may have suspicions about those from other countries, it is still our **DUTY** to care for the sick, feed the hungry, minister to and visit those in prison and so on. **REGARDLESS** of where they come from.

### WHOA!

Jesus said, ‚ÄúWhatever you did for the least of these you did for me‚Äù.

It‚Äôs important to note, Jesus didn‚Äôt say that **YOU** should separate the sheep from the goats. He said **YOU** (and I) should **CARE** for them and **HE** will do the separating.

I hope you will go read **ALL** of Matthew 25 and make your own decisions.

### Matthew 25: 35-40

‚ÄúThen the King will say to those on his right, ‚ÄòCome, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.‚Äô

‚ÄúThen the righteous will answer him, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?‚Äô

‚ÄúThe King will reply, ‚ÄòTruly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.‚Äô
