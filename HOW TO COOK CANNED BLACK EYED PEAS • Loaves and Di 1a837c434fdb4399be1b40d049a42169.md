## **WHAT DO BLACK EYED PEAS TASTE LIKE ?**

Black eyed peas definitely do not taste like a green pea at all. You will mostly be reminded of beans when you eat a black eyed pea, but they have an earthier flavor. If you have ever eaten ‚ÄúCow Peas‚Äù or ‚ÄúCrowder Peas‚Äù, these are in the same ball park.

If you would rather cook your black eyed peas in the crockpot instead of the stove top, that is fine too. Use the recipe below (you will probably need to scale up for a larger crock pot ‚Äì you can double, triple or increase this recipe to the size you need).

For the best flavor, sear the bacon on the stove top first then put it in the crockpot with your other ingredients. Set crockpot on low and everything should be ready to go in 6-8 hours.

## HOW TO COOK BLACK EYED PEAS WITH A HAM HOCK

You might have a leftover ham hock from the holidays and that works perfectly with these black eyed peas. When using a ham hock, you will want to leave off the bacon, increase the whole recipe using about 3-4 cans of black eyed peas (you want enough to absorb all the wonderful flavor from the ham hock!). There is no need to sear the ham hock first. Then do the following‚Ä¶.

### STOVE TOP

If you are using a the stove top, place all the ingredients (remember to multiple the spices for however many cans of beans you are using) into a 4-8 quart stock pot with the ham hock. Set the stove on medium low until the pot begins to simmer then reduce to low.

Check on your pot every 15-20 minutes and give it a slight stir to make sure nothing sticks. Add water as you need to. Simmer for an hour or two until the smell is so delicious that you can‚Äôt wait any longer!

### CROCKPOT

If you are cooking in a crockpot, simply place everything in the crockpot, but the lid on, set it on low and everything will be ready in 6-8 hours.

Today I am just thankful that God is just. I‚Äôm not always perfect, and I am sure you aren‚Äôt either. God sees and knows the contents of your heart, thankfully. I always pray that he will help me to conquer the less than flattering parts of my own heart.

He made me and knows even all the hairs on my head, so I am assuming he also knows what motivates me. I‚Äôm sure he shakes his head at me a lot. I thought, therefore, that I would share this verse from Hebrews 6.

### Hebrews 6: 9-10

Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case‚Äîthe things that have to do with salvation. God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.
