# Ingredients

- ¾ cup chopped raw nuts (such as pecans and/or walnuts)
- ¼ cup unsweetened coconut flakes
- 2 Tbsp. raw sesame seeds
- 1 cup pitted Medjool dates (about 6½ oz.)
- ¾ tsp. kosher salt
- 6 oz. bittersweet chocolate (about 1 cup), chopped
- 1 tsp. virgin coconut oil
- Flaky sea salt

# Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 300°.
2. Arrange 12 muffin liners on a large plate.
3. Spread nuts, coconut, and sesame seeds in an even layer on a small rimmed baking sheet and toast, stirring once or twice, until nuts are darkened and fragrant and coconut is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, boil [2 cups? — enough to cover dates] water.
5. Once boiling, add dates and remove from heat.
6. Let dates soak 10 minutes.
7. Drain dates, reserving soaking liquid.
8. Transfer dates and 2 Tbsp. soaking liquid to a food processor. Add kosher salt and pulse.
    1. Scrape down bowl occasionally, until smooth and creamy, with no large pieces of dates remaining.
    2. Be patient: It will take about 3–5 minutes.
    3. If you’re having trouble getting the dates to break down, add more soaking liquid 1 tsp. at a time. You should have about ½ cup date caramel.
9. Melt chocolate and oil in a heatproof bowl in the microwave in 20-second increments, stirring in between, until smooth and glossy, about 1 minute total.
10. Pour about 1½ tsp. melted chocolate into liners (no need to be exact).
11. Top with a small scoop of nut mixture, pressing to spread out the chocolate a bit (you want every nut to be in contact with chocolate so it won’t fall off).
12. Using 2 spoons, dollop about 1 Tbsp. date caramel into each, pressing to gently spread down and around.
13. Top with remaining melted chocolate, covering as much caramel and bare nuts as possible.
14. Sprinkle with remaining nut mixture and sea salt.
15. Chill until chocolate is firm, about 1 hour.
