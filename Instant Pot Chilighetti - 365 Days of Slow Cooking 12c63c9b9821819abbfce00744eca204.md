## Instant Pot Chilighetti

Spaghetti and chili combined into one dish is surprisingly delicious. Really. And topping the chilighetti with cheese and sour cream just puts it over top. Secretly, I just sneaked a few bites of leftovers for breakfast.

Youâ€™re going to love how easy this recipe is to make. The prep time is minimal. You brown the ground beef and then add everything else into the pot and walk away. I was able to get laundry done and unload the dishwasher while my dinner was making itself. Ahhh, that is a nice feeling! If youâ€™re busy but you still want to get dinner on the table try chilighetti this week! You may already have everything you need to make it.

### How do you make Instant Pot Chilighetti?

To make Instant Pot chilighetti youâ€™ll needâ€¦

- **1 pound lean ground beef or ground turkey**
- **Â¼ tsp salt** (I like kosher salt or sea salt)
- **Â¼ tsp pepper**
- **1 cup diced onion** (for convenience sake I used frozen diced onions)
- **1 Â¾ cup beef broth** (or you can use water and better than bouillon beef base)
- **8 oz spaghetti** (whole wheat spaghetti works fine)
- **1 (24 oz) jar of your favorite spaghetti sauce** (I like the Classico brand)
- **1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce**
- **1 Tbsp chili powder**
- **1 Tbsp cumin**
- **1 (14 oz) can red kidney beans, rinsed and drained**
- **Toppings: sour cream, grated cheddar cheese, diced red onions**
1. Turn Instant Pot to sautÃ© setting (toggle through until you get to MORE). Let the pot heat up and when the display says HOT add in the beef and break it up. I like using this [hamburger chopper tool](https://amzn.to/2UcfJ1o). Add in the salt and pepper. Add in the onions. Brown for about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease, if there is any. I used 90% lean ground beef and didnâ€™t drain any grease.
2. Pour in the beef broth and [scrape bottom of the pot](https://youtu.be/8NGInSlbtGc) so that nothing is sticking. This is important so you donâ€™t get the [BURN error message](https://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/the-instant-pot-burn-message/). Turn off the sautÃ© setting.
3. Break the spaghetti into 3-4 inch pieces. Place the broken spaghetti in a criss cross pattern on top of the meat and broth. The criss cross pattern helps so that the noodles donâ€™t stick together. Gently press down with a wooden spoon. All of the spaghetti wonâ€™t be in the liquid and that is okay.
4. Evenly dump the spaghetti sauce over the top of the noodles. Make sure the noodles are all covered. This will help them cook evenly.
5. Dump the Worcestershire, chili powder, cumin and beans on top. Donâ€™t stir!
6. Cover Instant Pot and secure the lid. Make sure valve is set to sealing. Set the manual/pressure cook button to 3 minutes. When time is up let pot sit for 10 minutes and then move valve to venting. Remove the lid.
7. Stir well. Scoop onto plates and top with a dollop of sour cream, cheese and onions. Yum yum!
