1. Start a large pot of water for the penne.
2. Pan fry some Italian sausage in a high temperature oil (I use sunflower oil) until it’s brown on the outside then turn it down. 
3. Fry the peppers and onions in a separate pan until they are translucent. (Don’t forget to salt and pepper your peppers and onions as you fry them.) 
4. Set the peppers and onions aside and slice the sausages into bite size pieces. 
5.  Add the penne to the water and stir it.
6. Add butter and a high temperature oil to the sausage pan and return the sausage pieces to brown the faces.
7. When the sausage is nicely browned, remove it to a plate with paper towels, pour off as much of the oil as you can.
8. Return the sausage pieces to the pan and pour in tomato sauce (I use a simple tomato basil sauce) and add the peppers and onions. 
9. Heat your oven up to 350 F. Taste the sauce and adjust the salt and pepper if necessary.
10. When the penne is done drain it, shake as much water out of it as possible, and put it back in the pot.
11. Add the sausage and sauce and stir.
12. Add two large handfuls of mozzarella and stir it in.
13. Dump the pasta and sauce into a 9" x 14" pan.
14. Add the mozzarella in an even layer across the top. Sprinkle Parmesan over the mozzarella.
15. Put the pan in the top third of the oven and set a timer for 20 minutes.
16. When the timer goes off, turn it 180 degrees and set a timer for another 15 minutes.
17. When the timer goes off check it, turn it one more time, and leave it for 5 minutes. At this point you’re just looking for a nice, crispy cheese crust on top.
18. Let it cool, and the cheese melt. About 5 minutes.
