## Ingredients

- Oil for spritzing
- 1 pkg (18–21 oz./540 g) dark chocolate fudge brownie mix (plus ingredients to make cake-like brownies)
- 15 mini peppermint patty candies, unwrapped
- 2 candy canes or 8–10 peppermint hard candies
- 1 cup (250 mL) semi-sweet or milk chocolate morsels
- ¼ cup (50 mL) heavy whipping cream
- Homemade whipped cream or vanilla ice cream (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. Use the Kitchen Spritzer to spray the bottom of the 12” (30-cm) Nonstick Skillet with oil.
3. Prepare cake-like brownies according to the directions.
4. Pour ¾ of the batter into the skillet and spread to evenly coat the bottom of the pan.
5. Arrange the peppermint patties evenly on top of the batter.
6. Use the Small Scoop to scoop the remaining batter on top of the patties to cover.
7. Bake for 25–27 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted 1” (2.5 cm) from the edge comes out clean.
8. Meanwhile, place the peppermint candies in a resealable plastic bag and crush with the flat side of the Meat Tenderizer.
9. Place the chocolate morsels and heavy whipping cream in a medium Silicone Prep Bowl.
10. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH for 30 seconds, or until melted. Stir to combine.
11. Remove the skillet from the oven.
12. Pour the melted chocolate mixture over the top and spread to cover.
13. Top with crushed candies and slice into 16 squares.
14. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream, if desired.
