Description: Before we begin, I know some antsy readers out there simply can't wait to lecture me about how watermelons should never be grilled and called burgers. That's myopic nonsense based on macho barbecue logic. Grilling watermelon is awesome, and I truly feel for the people who are too hung up on keeping each food in its lane to try something new.
