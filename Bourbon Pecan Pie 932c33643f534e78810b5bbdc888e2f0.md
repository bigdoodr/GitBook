WEEKNIGHT VEGETARIAN NOV 17, 2015 This vegan pie is spiked with booze and packed with nuts – in pieces in the filling and in halves on top. You’ll need a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Serve with whipped coconut cream or dairy-free ice cream. Make Ahead: The pie dough needs to be refrigerated for at least 30 minutes. The filling and the crust can each be refrigerated for up to 1 week before assembling and baking. The crust can be frozen for up to 3 months; defrost before rolling out. The baked pie can be made a day in advance. SERVINGS: Tested size: 8-10 servings; makes one 9-inch pie INGREDIENTS FOR THE CRUST 1 1/2 cups (7 1/2 ounces) flour 3 tablespoons plus 2 1/4 teaspoons granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup chilled vegan shortening, such as Earth Balance, cut into 1/4-inch pieces, plus more for greasing the pie plate 3 tablespoons cold water FOR THE FILLING 4 1/4 cups pecan halves 1/4 cup vegan shortening, such as Earth Balance 1/3 cup flour 1/2 cup bourbon 2/3 cup water 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon maple syrup 1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) lightly packed brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon vanilla extract DIRECTIONS For the crust: Combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor; pulse until just combined. Add the vegan shortening and pulse 5 to 7 times or just until the mixture is crumbly. Add the cold water and pulse 5 to 7 times or just until the mixture mostly comes together to form a dough. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface; briefly knead until incorporated. Do not overwork, or the crust will be tough. Form into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 week. The Washington Post Recipe Finder Bourbon Pecan Pie When you scale a recipe, keep in mind that cooking times and temperatures, pan sizes and seasonings may be affected, so adjust accordingly. Also, amounts listed in the directions will not reflect the changes made to ingredient amounts. Lightly grease the pie plate with a little vegan shortening. Roll the chilled pie dough between layers of plastic wrap to a round that’s 13 inches across; transfer it to the pie plate and fit it in, trimming off any overhanging dough or folding it under. Crimp the edges above the rim to allow extra headroom to hold the filling, which will puff up as the pie bakes. Loosely cover and refrigerate while you make the filling. For the filling: Coarsely chop 3 cups of the pecans, saving the remaining 1 1/4 cups (halves) for the top of the pie. Melt the vegan shortening in a medium, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour; whisk until golden brown, 5 minutes. Stir in the bourbon and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid is almost evaporated and the mixture is a thick paste, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in the water and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Whisk in the maple syrup, brown sugar and salt; cook until the mixture bubbles and begins to thicken, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract and the 3 cups of chopped pecans. Let cool for a few minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the pie plate (lined with its chilled dough) on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Pour in the filling, then decoratively arrange the remaining pecan halves on top. Bake until the filling rises and bubbles and the crust browns, 25 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely (at least 1 hour) before serving or storing.
