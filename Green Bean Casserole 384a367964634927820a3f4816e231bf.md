By Bonnie S. Benwick | November 6, 2018 Roasted Red Pepper Mac and Cheese Active: 20 mins Total: 30 mins Servings: 10 to 12 Mac and cheese graces many holiday tables; this one comes together on the stove top and is special enough to earn an annual berth. A puree of roasted red pepper adds zip to the creaminess, while a topping of crisp, crushed Cheez-Its is pure genius. The CapMac food truck brings this goodness to the streets of the District. Make Ahead: The dish can be made up to 3 days in advance, minus the Cheez-Its. Reheat on the stove top, covered, over low heat. Ingredients • Kosher salt • 1 pound dried elbow macaroni • 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter • 1/2 cup flour • 6 cups warmed milk (in a microwave for a few minutes) • 24 ounces white cheddar, shredded • 3 jarred, roasted red peppers, drained and pureed (use a blender or mini food processor) • 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard • 1 tablespoon Spanish smoked paprika (sweet or hot) • Freshly ground black pepper • 1 1/2 cups crushed Cheez-Its, for garnish Step 1 Bring a pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add a generous pinch of salt and the macaroni; cook to al dente (a little underdone), according to the package directions. Drain well, then return to the pot. Step 2 Meanwhile, melt the butter in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle in the flour; whisk constantly for a few minutes to form a smooth paste (roux). Increase the heat to medium-high; gradually add the warmed milk while you continue to whisk, forming a smooth sauce. Cook for a total of 3 to 5 minutes, then add the shredded cheddar in two or three additions, allowing the batches to melt each time. Step 3 Add the pureed red peppers, mustard, smoked paprika, and a pinch of black pepper, stirring to incorporate. The sauce should be a deep orange color; taste, and add salt, as needed. Step 4 Pour the sauce into the macaroni, stirring to coat evenly. Cook over low heat for a few minutes, to meld flavors and warm the pasta through. Step 5 To serve, transfer to a warmed serving dish and top with the crushed Cheez-Its.
