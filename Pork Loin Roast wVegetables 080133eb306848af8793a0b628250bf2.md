# Ingredients

- 2 to 2 ½ pound boneless pork loin roast
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- ½ teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- ¾ teaspoon lemon zest
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 cup chicken broth (you can also use wine, beer, or water)
- 4 large carrots chopped into 1’’ pieces
- 2 large potatoes chopped into 1’’ pieces
- ½ yellow onion chopped

# Instructions

1. Take pork loin out of the fridge 20 minutes before cooking.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the melted butter, garlic, brown sugar, soy sauce, lemon zest, parsley, and thyme.
3. Season pork loin with salt and pepper; then, brush the butter mixture all around the meat. Set aside.
4. Press the Sauté function on the Instant Pot and heat up the olive oil.
5. When oil is hot, sear the pork loin on all sides until browned, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.
6. Remove pork from IP and set aside.
7. Add broth (or wine, beer, or water) to the Instant Pot and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom.
8. Cancel the Sauté function and place a trivet in the IP and set the pork on top of the trivet.
9. Lock the lid and pressure cook at HIGH PRESSURE for 15 minutes.
10. Then, let pressure come down naturally for 15 minutes, and quick release any remaining pressure.
11. Open the lid and check internal temperature with an instant read meat thermometer; it should read 145˚F. If it’s less than this, you can place the lid back on the pot to let the carryover heat cook the pork to doneness. Shouldn’t take more than 2 to 3 minutes.
12. Take out and cover with aluminum foil, letting rest for 15 minutes before cutting, to help seal in the juices.
13. Meanwhile, add the carrots, potatoes, onions, etc. to the Instant Pot. Place lid back on the pressure cooker and set to 5 minutes.
14. When done, quick release pressure, and remove veggies from the Instant Pot.
15. Slice the pork and serve with the veggies, covering in pan juices, if desired.
