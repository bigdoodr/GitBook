An easy, four-ingredient candy for peanut butter fans... because not everyone loves chocolate. If you've ever made one of the many fudge recipes featured on packages of Baker's chocolate or cans of condensed milk, odds are good you've employed the microwave. How can you possibly make decent fudge in a microwave? You can't But you can make a darn nice fudge-like candy. And what's even better is that since it steers clear of the cooktop, kids can make it all by themselves...if Mom and Dad say it's okay. This recipe first appeared in Season 7 of Good Eats.

### Software

- 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more for greasing pan

### Procedure

- Grease an 8-inch square pan with butter. Trim a piece of parchment paper to 8 inches wide and line the pan with the parchment sling, leaving enough overhand on two sides to cover the top of the fudge with later.
- Combine the butter and peanut butter in a 4-quart microwave-safe bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Poke a few holes in the plastic wrap to vent the steam, then microwave for 2 minutes on high. Stir and microwave on high for 2 more minutes. (Use caution when removing this mixture from the microwave, it will be very hot.) Add the vanilla and powdered sugar to the peanut butter mixture and stir to combine with a wooden spoon. The mixture will become hard to stir and lose its sheen.
- Spread mixture into prepared pan. Fold the excess parchment paper so it covers the surface of the fudge and refrigerate until cool, about 2 hours. Cut into 1-inch pieces and store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.
