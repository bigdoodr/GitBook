By Becky Krystal | November 14 Libby’s New-Fashioned Pumpkin Pie With Dulce de Leche and Cardamom Active: 15 mins Total: 1 hour 10 mins, plus cooling time Servings: 8 to 10 (makes one 9-inch pie) This dish is part of a collection of classic back-of-the-package recipes that we’ve upgraded for your Thanksgiving table with a few simple twists. Libby’s Pumpkin has updated its back-of-the-package pie for the first time since 1950, and we’ve taken the modifications a little further. The updated recipe eliminated granulated sugar in favor of sweetened condensed milk, and we figured dulce de leche made a natural next step. (Feel free to use the sweetened condensed if you prefer.) The result is a smooth, slightly caramelized pie with deeper flavor, a lovely, burnished color and an almost flan-like texture. We amped up the spices, too — increasing the ginger and cinnamon, and subbing floral cardamom and earthy nutmeg for the cloves. Adjust these flavors, or add others, to suit your taste. Recipe notes: You’ll need a 9- or 9 1/2-inch pie dish. For a homemade crust, we recommend this Flaky Pie Dough. The pie can be made up to 2 days in advance; cover and refrigerate.

Ingredients • One 13.4-ounce can dulce de leche, such as La Lechera brand • 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more for optional garnish • 1 teaspoon ground cardamom • 3/4 teaspoon ground ginger • 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg • 1/2 teaspoon salt • 2 large eggs • One 15-ounce can pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling) • 1 cup evaporated milk • One unbaked 9 or 9 1/2-inch pie shell, store-bought or homemade (see related recipe above) • Whipped cream, for garnish (optional) Step 1 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees with the rack in the middle.

It should be just warm, not hot, and soft enough to be easily incorporated into the filling. Let cool slightly. Step 3 In a small bowl, whisk together the cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, nutmeg and salt. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until combined. Whisk in the pumpkin and spice mixture. Gradually whisk in the evaporated milk. Whisk in the dulce de leche a little at a time, fully incorporating after each addition. Pour the filling into the pie shell. Step 4 Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted near center comes out clean. The pie will be mostly set but still jiggle a bit in the center. Step 5 Cool on a wire rack for 2 hours. Top with the whipped cream and dust with cinnamon, if desired. Serve immediately or refrigerate until needed.
