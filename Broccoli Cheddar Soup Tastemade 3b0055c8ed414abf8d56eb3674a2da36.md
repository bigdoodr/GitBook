## Ingredients

- 2 butter pats
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 carrot, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup All purpose flour
- 1 cup whole milk
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 3 cups homemade vegetable broth
- 5 cups chopped broccoli, from stalks and florets (save some florets for garnish)
- Pinch of grated nutmeg
- 2 cups grated cheddar cheese
- Salt and pepper
1. Heat a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the butter, oil, onion, carrot, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper and cook until softened and onions are translucent, 5-7 minutes. Add the flour to the pot and cook while stirring for 2 additional minutes to create a roux. Whisk in the milk and heavy cream. Once mixture has started to thicken, drop the stock (A.K.A. add the broth). Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. After 10 minutes, add 4 cups of broccoli florets and stalks along with the nutmeg, and continue to cook for 20 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Turn the heat off of the soup and stir in the cheese until melted. Blend with an immersion blender and season to taste. Serve warm and top with reserved florets and croutons.
3. Cook's Tip: peel the broccoli stems before chopping them to add to the soup.
4. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the bread cubes with oil, salt and pepper. Place in an even layer on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes or until toasty and golden brown.
