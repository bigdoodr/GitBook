How to live your best life when itâ€™s cold outside: Throw on a pair of sweatpants, make this spin on chicken pot pie, and spoon it into your mouth as you cuddle up on the couch. Iâ€™m speaking from experience here.

When it comes to making dinner for myself (that is to say, without the intention of whipping out the cameras and writing up a post about it), a lot of people assume Iâ€™m whipping up creative and labor intensive meals from scratch, donning my apron, flittering about like some sort of dinnertime Disney princess (which I can assure you is never, ever the case).

In reality, Iâ€™m gravitating towards the raid-the pantry-for-quick-fix-ingredients, use-up-the-fridge-stragglers, and throw-it-all-together-and-see-what-you-get side of things. And thatâ€™s exactly how this Skillet Cheddar-Cornbread BBQ Chicken Pot Pie began.

What it turned into, though, is a recipe that I intentionally buy ingredients for week in and week out, and one that I realized I absolutely had to share with you guys.

This recipe is everything you love about comfort food staples, but made new and easier and better together.

Using shortcut ingredients like corn muffin mix, frozen vegetables, and premade BBQ sauce keeps this dish weeknight-dinner friendly and inexpensive, while flavorful add-ins like buttery chicken breasts, onion, garlic, cheddar cheese, and jalapeÃ±o slices make for a filling, delicious meal. Skillet Cheddar-Cornbread BBQ Chicken Pot Pie is exactly the kind of meal you crave after a long day of workâ€“ simple and satisfyingâ€“ but also the kind youâ€™re going to want to make for friends when they come over on football Sundays.

You know what I mean? *That kind of* comfort food. AKA the best kind.

I had a hard name deciding what to name this recipe because no one part is better than the other. So I just put *all* of the info in there.

I love that this recipe is made in a skillet because it makes it so easy to go from the stovetop to the oven and whip it all together in one pan, which is essential to any easy meal. I donâ€™t want to be fussing with a dozen different pots and pans and baking dishes, I just want it all to cook and bake together with as little messy cleanup necessary afterward. Whoâ€™s with me there? I know you are.

And then thereâ€™s the cheddar-spiked cornbread crust, which, in my humble opinion, is *so* much better than any traditional, roll-out pre-made crusts, and far faster and less frustrating than homemade ones. Plus, itâ€™s cheesy cornbread instead of pie crust. I mean, I *like* pie crust and all, but cornbread isnâ€™t just a topping, itâ€™s a side-dish re-imagined. And did I mention all of the cheese? Thereâ€™s a clear better choice here.

Oh, and you can press some jalapeno slices into it too, if thatâ€™s your sort of thing. Itâ€™s definitely *my* sort of thing.

Lastly but not least-ly, we need to talk about that BBQ chicken filling, which is so saucy and chock full of vegetables that you wonder why you ever considered making pot pie any other way. You definitely want to make sure that your frozen vegetable mix has corn in it, by the way, because the little kernels of corn sprinkled throughout the barbecue sauce just tie that cornbread topping in even more and really make this dish feel like a happy reminder of warmer days while you try to survive the chillier months.

When it comes to BBQ sauces, use your favorite. As long as itâ€™s relatively thick (because no one wants a runny pot pie), you can pick any one your heart desires. That is, unless you happen to live near Oneonta, NY. Then you absolutely have to use Brookâ€™s BBQ sauce so I can live vicariously through you.

Okay, you donâ€™t *have* to do anything. Just as long as you hurry up and get started so you can have this skillet for dinner tonight. ðŸ˜Š
