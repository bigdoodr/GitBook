## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 5 medium carrots, cut into coins (2 cups)
- 6 celery stalks, cut into half moons (2 cups)
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic (about 4 cloves)
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 bay leaf
- 10 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 cups cooked wide egg noodles (about 3 ounces dried noodles)
- 2½ cups mixed shredded dark and light rotochick meat (from a large rotisserie chicken)”

## Preparation

In a big soup pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, garlic, thyme, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring, until the carrots soften slightly, about 5 minutes. Add the bay leaf and chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes to meld the flavors.

Stir in the noodles and chicken and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes longer. Season to taste with more salt and pepper and discard the bay leaf. Serve with buttered saltines, if you want to be like me and my dad.
