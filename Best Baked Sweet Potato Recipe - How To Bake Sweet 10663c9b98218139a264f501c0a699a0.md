I love to enjoy [sweet potatoes](https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/thanksgiving/g622/sweet-potato-recipes/) year round, but when fall hits, I'm ready to have them for practically any meal. Theyâ€™re a total superfood (packed with vitamin C and fiber), are delicious sweet or savory, and add a boost of color and variety to my plate. Plus, theyâ€™re endlessly versatile: You can [roast them](https://www.delish.com/cooking/a22639681/how-to-roast-sweet-potatoes/), [mash them](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a55384/best-mashed-sweet-potato-recipe/), [air fry](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a28136123/air-fryer-sweet-potato-recipe/) themâ€¦the possibilities are endless. When I'm searching for an easy side or the base to my dinner, I love to bake them whole in the oven. Itâ€™s arguably the simplest (only the [microwave](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a22565452/microwave-sweet-potato/) might have it beat) way to prep the potatoes, and definitely the most versatile.

## How To Bake Sweet Potatoes

## Step-By-Step Instructions

The worst way to ruin a [sweet potato casserole](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a55342/sweet-potato-casserole-recipe/) is with a gritty texture. That's why I scrub the skins lightly to get rid of any dirt and soil, then throughly dry before using. This is an important step I highly recommend not skipping to get the best baked sweet potatoes.

Make sure and prick your potatoes with a fork before baking. The pricking technique is always used when baking [russet](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a22553662/how-to-bake-a-potato-in-the-oven/) or sweet potatoesâ€”the holes help to reduce baking time and ensure the potatoes won't burst during the long bake time by providing steam vents.

Depending on your preference, you may or may not want to eat the skins too. If I'm planning to, I rub the sweet potatoes in a small amount of olive oil before baking to crisp them up and add extra flavor.

Baked Sweet Potatoes

After baking, let the potatoes cool slightly, split the tops open, and dot with butter that will melt from the residual heat. Season with a little salt and pepper, and you're ready to go.

## Recipe Tips

- *The foil:* Sweet potatoes tend to get a little juicy while bakingâ€”these juices can caramelize and be a pain to deal with afterwards. Lining the baking sheet first with foil or parchment ensures an easy clean up. No need to wrap your potatoes in foil thoughâ€”you want them to really feel that oven heat, rather than steam.

â€¢ *The skins:* Removing the skin is completely up to you. I personally enjoy the texture of sweet potato skin, and you'll get some added nutrients and fiber.

â€¢ *The flavorings:* I keep it super-simple here with just oil, salt, and pepper. And a traditional pat of butter to serve. But of course you can add dried spices, like cumin and chili powder, or use hearty herbs such as rosemary. Swap sour cream or crÃ¨me fraÃ®che for the butter. Just be sure not to skimp on the salt.

â€¢ *The bake time:* Depending on your oven and size of potato, it will likely take between 45 and 55 minutes to achieve perfect potatoes. Just be patient and test by sticking a knife or fork into the thickest part of the potato. If thereâ€™s no resistance, itâ€™s good to go.
