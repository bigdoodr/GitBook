Classic lasagna is great, but sometimes it's too much work. Our Quick Lasagna Toss is perfect when you've got a craving but don't want all the fuss.

### What You'll Need

- 12 lasagna noodles, broken into large pieces
- 1 pound hot Italian sausage, casing removed
- 1 (26-ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

### What to Do

1. Cook noodles according to package directions; drain.
2. Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, cook sausage 6 to 8 minutes, or until no pink remains, stirring to crumble sausage; drain. Add noodles and remaining ingredients; mix well.
3. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook 6 to 8 minutes, or until heated through and the cheese has melted. Serve immediately.

Can you use ground meat instead sausage?

Good stuff! I decreased the amount of mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Eliminated the ricotta cheese altogether. Goes together quickly. Good for those times when you need to put together a meal in a hurry, Add a green salad, some bread and glass of chianti and you're good to go!

I've been on a hunt for quick and easy recipes and this is one of them! This was good! I cooked the sauce and meat for a while before adding the noodles, then added the cheeses and cooked for another 5 minutes. The heat from the hot sausage was a little much for my kids but I liked it. Will use a mild sausage next time but definitely a keeper. Ooh, its so easy!

Can you use cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese?

Cottage cheese can be substituted for ricotta, but the two are not perfectly interchangeable. Ricotta is dryer and has a finer, 'grainy' texture, whereas cottage cheese has a good bit more moisture and a lumpier texture. You might consider giving the cottage a brief whirl in your blender or your electric mixer to make it less lumpy, and perhaps drain it for a while in a paper towel-lined strainer to let some of the moisture out. A Portugese friend of ours used to make an excellent lasagna using cottage cheese, because we couldn't get ricotta at the time. He mixed an egg into it to 'tighten up' the more moist cottage cheese.
