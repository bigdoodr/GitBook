It never occurred to me that pancakes could be made in the oven. What a great idea, and it was fun to make something we like so much in a new way. Just a note to reviewer Jessaca: I don't think that you should have expected the pancakes to be sweet. I have never used an original pancake recipe that was sweet. That's what syrup, apple butter, lemon curd, etc. is for.

It was a simple recipe to make and my family liked it. Next time, to enhance the flavor, I would add a tsp. of vanilla, a tsp. of cinnamon and to brown it up some sugar. (Perhaps, a Tablespoon to start.) It will take a bit of experimenting. I also found out if you bake for 5 minutes and then add the blueberries and strawberries, it makes for prettier sheet pancakes.
